EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud.. 

Instances = Server = VMs/ Virtual Machines / Azure VM / GCP Engine


On-Demand ec2 Instance : No stable workload, Non Predictable use cases, If you want to test your application for the first time.. 
Pricing : per hr basis..  /sec basis (With min of 60 Sec)..


Reserved Instances (RI) : FOr long term runs, Stable work loads.. Less cost compared to On-Demand. Duration : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs.. 

RI : 
	--> Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.
	--> Convertable RI : We can chnage the configuration. 
	--> Scheduled RI : Repeated tasks for a duration.

Pricing : 
	--> Full Upfront : Pay everything while purchasing. 
	--> Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% while purchasing, Remaining monthly basis with reduced pricing. 
	--> No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.


SPOT Instances : If we have flexible start / stop duration, If any server terminates application not gonna effect.. 
--> Spot Feet requests
--> Pricing History

16CPU, 32 RAM Server.. 1$/Hr.. Bid your price against aws pricing..  
: 0.50$/Month.. Duration


0.10$/Hr...   1.45 Hr.. Price increased and AWS terminated instance.. = 0.10$
0.10$/Hr...   1.45 Hr.. Price not increased and you terminated instance.. = 0.20$


Tenancy : 
--> Shared Tenancy : Underlying hardware shares with Multiple customers.
--> Dedicated tenancy : Underlying h/w will not share with any other customer.
	--> Dedicated host : 
	--> Dedicated Instance :

EC2 : Region specif Service..!! 
Mumbai  :
N Virginia : 

Free Tier : 
750 Hours/Month : 1 Server = 1 Month.. t2.micro.. Windows Instance
750 Hours/Month : 1 Server = 1 Month.. t2.micro.. Linux Instance


Windows Instance Launch : 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 		: OS
AMI : template of an OS with required applications and services to run our instance.
Windows Server 2016 Base

Step 2 : Choose an instance Type			: CPU, RAM, Network

Free tier : t2.micro

t3.medium : 2 vCPU, 4 RAM
c5.xlarge : c5.xlarge 4 vCPU, 8 RAM
m4.2xlarge 8 vCPU, 32 RAM

general purpose : t2, t3, t3a, m3, m4, m5a
COmpute : c4, c5, c5n
GPU : p2, g4
Memory : r4, r5, r5d, x1
Storage : i2, d


General Purpose : General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, and are a good choice for many applications. 

Compute optimized : instances have a higher ratio of vCPUs to memory than other families, and the lowest cost per vCPU among all Amazon EC2 instance types.

GPU instances provide graphics processing units (GPUs) along with high CPU and network performance for applications benefiting from highly parallelized processing, including 3D graphics, HPC, rendering, and media processing applications.

Memory optimized instances have the lowest cost per GB of RAM among Amazon EC2 instance types.

Storage optimized instances provides you with direct-attached storage options optimized for applications with specific disk I/O and storage capacity requirements.


Step 3 : Configure additional options			: 

Shutdown behavior : Stop / Terminate 	--> STOP
Termination protection : 


Step 4 : Choose Storage					: Storage (SSD/HDD/Magnetic)

Step 5 : Configure Tags					: Add tags (Max 50 Tags)

Step 6 : Configure SG					: Port/Protocol.. 

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : 22 : 0.0.0.0/0

OS : 0-65535 Port numbers.. 

Step 7 : Review and Launch With a Keypair.		: For UN & Pwd

.pem file --> 

Public Key : AWS keeps the public key with them, They place it in our instance.
Private Key : Gives to us when we create a keypair..  



How to connect : 
Windows : mstsc / Remote desktop connections.. 

--> Goto start --> look for "Remote Desktop conection"--> open
--> goto "run" --> enter "mstsc"
--> choose instance --> goto "Actions" --> Connect --> Down load "remote desktop file".


Task : Create another user in our ec2 instance, Provide him "RDP permissions" and "Local admin rights".

Try to login to the instance with newly created user.
