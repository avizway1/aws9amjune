--> Soft limit for bucket count : 100

Bucket Naming Limitations: 

Min : 3 Char, 63 Char
Should not start with Capital letters.
Should not start with . / end with . / no ..
Bucket name should not resemble IP address format.


Off : Block all public access... AT bucket level.. 


Standard Path: 
https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual Path: 
https://bucketname.s3.region.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Based on selected storage class, and data transfering, we'll get charged.
--> We have unlimited storage in s3 platform.
--> We have a limit for Object size.. 
--> Max object size s3 supports is 5 TB..

Versioning :
--> We can track all changes happening on our file.

Version : HIDE
--> We can get file back if we delete accidentally. 
--> We will get a Delete marker, Delete the DM, we can get file back.

Version : SHOW.
--> If we delete anything, it won' give us the Delete Marker.


LCR : Transit object from one storage class to another storage class using LCR. At some point of time, we can trigger to delete the latest version object / Previous verion object.


CRR / SRR : 
___________

Cross Region Replication
Same region replciation

Server access logging : Want to enable logging on a single bucket. 


Static website hosting : 
--> Easy to Manage
--> For our website also we'll get 99.99% avail, 99.999999999% durability
--> No OS Patches/ No OS level operations required.

--> We should give atleast readOnly permissions for everyone.
--> Bucket Name should be same as Domain Name.

http://bucketname.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com	--> avinash.website

http status codes:

2XX : OK / SUCCESS
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client Side error
5XX : Service side error


Encryptions : 

--> In-Transite Encryption
	--> SSL / TLS enabled

--> Server Side Encryption / At-Rest Encryption
	
--> SSE - S3 (S3 manages the Pubic and private Keys) : Who have valid permissions on s3 platform can decrypt the data.

--> SSE - KMS (KMS Manages the Public and Private Keys, Key material also generates by KMS only) :  

	--> AWS Managed keys : aws/s3 : Who have valid permissions on s3 platform can 					decrypt the data.
	--> Customer Managed Key : We need to define, who can administrate the key 
					We can define who can use the key.
	(NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY For CUstomer Managed KEY).

--> SSE - C (KMS Manages the Public and Private Keys but Customer need to upload the key material (public key and private key))


--> Client Side Encryption : Before uploading data to s3 platform, in our local devices/ environment we can encrypt the data with our own encry mechanism.



Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations

Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations
